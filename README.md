Hello!
This repo contains some mindmaps for topics I am interested in. It is mainly connected to mathematics, optimization and machine learning. 
Some of them could deviate though.

Minmaps included in two languages — russian (as my native language) and english. 
I have made them for educational purposes, but you can deal with them as you want. 
Also later I will add original .xmind files, as mindmaps made in [XMind](https://www.xmind.app/) app. 

Here you can see a part of such a «map»: ![Part of nlp in russian, language models](https://github.com/breadfan/minmaps-for-everything/blob/main/nlp/screen%20of%20language%20models%20part.PNG)
