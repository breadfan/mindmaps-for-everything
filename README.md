Hello!
This repo contains some mindmaps for topics I am interested in. It is mainly connected to mathematics, optimization and machine learning. 
Some of them could deviate though.

Mindmaps are included in two languages — russian (as my native language) and english (not yet though). 
I have made them for educational purposes, but you can deal with them as you want. 
Also later I will add original .xmind files, as mindmaps made in [XMind](https://www.xmind.app/) app. 

For the big maps (not for all) I also added their components, — you may check the [nlp](https://github.com/breadfan/mindmaps-for-everything/tree/main/nlp) one, for example.

Here you can see a part of such a «map»: ![Part of nlp in russian, language models](https://github.com/breadfan/minmaps-for-everything/blob/main/nlp/screen%20of%20language%20models%20part.PNG)
